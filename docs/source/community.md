## Formatting and Linting
Hub uses Black and Flake8 to ensure a consistent code format throughout the project.
if you are using vscode then Replace `.vscode/settings.json` content with the following:
```json
{
    "[py]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    },
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.flake8Path": "flake8",
    "python.linting.flake8Args": [
        "--max-line-length=80",
        "--select=B,C,E,F,W,B950",
        "--ignore=E203,E501,W503"
    ],
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
}
```
